IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

üìåOverview

This project aims to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using traditional machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression, we create a lightweight yet highly accurate sentiment analysis model, suitable for both educational purposes and real-world applications.

1. Text Preprocessing

Convert to lowercase

Remove punctuation and numbers

Remove HTML tags

Clean the text using regex

2. Feature Extraction

Apply TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert textual data into numerical features

Use max_features=5000 and stop_words='english' to reduce dimensionality and focus on important terms

3. Label Encoding
   
Sentiments are mapped: positive ‚Üí 1, negative ‚Üí 0

4. Model Training

Use Logistic Regression, a binary classifier known for its speed and effectiveness

Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing

5. Evaluation Metrics
   
Accuracy Score: ~88%

Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix: Gives insight into true/false positives and negatives

6. Word Importance
   
Extract top 10 positive and negative keywords based on logistic regression coefficients

Top Positive Words: great, excellent, amazing, perfect, wonderful

Top Negative Words: worst, awful, boring, waste, poor

üí°Model Performance

Metric	Score
Accuracy	88.39%
Precision	~0.88
Recall	~0.88
F1 Score	~0.88

The model performs consistently across both sentiment classes.
